I am a Ph.D. candidate at the School of Information, Florida State University, where I work on broadband policy and digital equity, under the supervision of Dr. Charles Hinnant. 

My research interests span digital equity, broadband policy, policy and ethics of emerging technologies, and ICT for development. 

Prior to my PhD, I have worked as a tenured-track lecturer at Information Systems department, Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember, Indonesia. I received my M.Sc. in Management of Technology from Delft University of Technology, where I analyzed business models and process models of telecommunication services. I was supervised by Dr. Harry Bouwman and Dr. Mark de Reuver. I earned a bachelor's degree in Information Systems from Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember, specializing in machine learning. 


My Current Research
======
In today's era, everyone—regardless of their income, geographical areas, or social bacgrounds—deserves access to affordable and reliable broadband so that they can fully participate in the society. My research analyzes both the institutional factors that shape broadband availability and the individual-level challenges that affect the participation of low-income households in the affordable broadband program. Specific for my dissertation, I aim to find out the reasons for participation/non-participation of low-income households in an affordable broadband program established by the FCC called the Affordable Connectivity Program.
