I am a Ph.D. candidate at the School of Information, Florida State University, where I work on broadband policy and digital equity, under the supervision of Dr. Charles Hinnant. 

My Research Interest
======
My research interests span digital equity, broadband policy, information policy, and information ethics. 

My Current Research
======
In today's era, I believe that everyone—regardless of their income, geographical areas, or social bacgrounds—deserves access to affordable and reliable broadband, so that they can fully participate in the society. I use mixed-methods approaches—combining statistical analysis, surveys, and qualitative inquiry—to examine both the structural factors that shape broadband availability and the individual-level challenges that affect program participation. My work bridges top-down policy analysis with bottom-up implementation, aiming to inform more inclusive and effective digital access strategies for underserved communities.

My dissertation explores the reasons for participation/non-participation of low-income households in an affordable broadband program established by the FCC.

My research interests span digital equity, broadband policy, and public sector capacity, with a focus on how institutional structures and information barriers affect access to affordable internet. I explore both the design of policy at the state level and its implementation on the ground, aiming to support more inclusive and effective digital access for underserved communities.


My research aims to explore how socially-aware natural language processing systems can improve our understanding of human social behaviour and effectively accommodate diverse individual preferences and needs. I am also interested in assessing the ethical integrity of such technologies to ensure their safety and responsible use.



This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [Academic Pages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the repository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. Incidentally, these same features make it a great template for anyone that needs to show off a professional template!

You can fork [this template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and Markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads!

A data-driven personal website
======
Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, Academic Pages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured Markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various Markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.

Many of the features of dynamic content management systems (like Wordpress) can be achieved in this fashion, using a fraction of the computational resources and with far less vulnerability to hacking and DDoSing. You can also modify the theme to your heart's content without touching the content of your site. If you get to a point where you've broken something in Jekyll/HTML/CSS beyond repair, your Markdown files describing your talks, publications, etc. are safe. You can rollback the changes or even delete the repository and start over - just be sure to save the Markdown files! You can also write scripts that process the structured data on the site, such as [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb) that analyzes metadata in pages about talks to display [a map of every location you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html).

For those users that need more advanced functionality, the template also supports the following popular tools:
- [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) for mathematical equations
- [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/) for diagraming
- [Plotly](https://plotly.com/javascript/) for plotting

More info about configuring Academic Pages can be found in [the guide](https://academicpages.github.io/markdown/), the [growing wiki](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/wiki), and you can always [ask a question on GitHub](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/discussions). The [guides for the Minimal Mistakes theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/configuration/) (which this theme was forked from) might also be helpful.
